# Frontend Weekly

Front-end Weekly is based on [Hylia](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia) which is a lightweight [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) pre-configured.

## For Editors

You can use Netlify CMS to create new post but if you like writing posts in your favorite markdown editor like me then you can do following:

```
npm run post:new -- --vol=${vol} --date=${date in YYYY-MM-DD}
```

This will fetch contents from "Curated" list in our Trello board.
