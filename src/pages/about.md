keybits.net is the personal blog and website of Tom Atkins. I use 'keybits' as a username on various sites on the Internet. Here you'll find posts about computer and Internet technologies with a sprinkling of sustainability, remote working, and life thoughts. Occasional photos might appear too.

I'm an advocate of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web">Open Web</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software">open source software.</a>

Promoting the idea of a [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) is how I entertain people in conversation :-)

## Current work

I like to use my IT skills to help people get useful things done with computers.  Currently I work remotely for [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) as a Support Engineering Manager. Previously I was head of the Support team at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).

## Remote working and living amongst nature

Living in beautiful West Cork, Ireland provides opportunities for outdoor activities that contrast with time spent working on computers. I've worked remotely for over a decade and feel incredibly lucky to be able to enjoy living in a rural area and earn a living for my family.
