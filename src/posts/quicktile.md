I use a 27" 2560 x 1440 display for programming. To make the most of all these pixels it's important to be able to quickly arrange your windows to fill the screen.

There are [many impressive tiling window managers](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=18273) for Linux but I like to retain the flexibility of manually stacking and resizing windows.

Back when I used Windows, [WinSplit revolution](http://www.winsplit-revolution.com/) was a handy keyboard driven way to emulate basic window tiling without committing to a full-on tiling window manager.

[QuickTile](http://ssokolow.com/quicktile/) works in a similar way and is easily customisable since it is [open source](https://github.com/ssokolow/quicktile) and written in Python.

I have most of the keys bound to actions on the num-pad with a Ctrl + Alt modifier. This gives me enough tiling options to quickly set up a working environment of text editor, console(s) and web browser. QuickTile has worked reliably for me in KDE and now XFCE on Xubuntu 12.10.

Highly recommended.
